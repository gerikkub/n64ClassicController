This code will read in a Nintendo 64 controller and fake it as being a wii classic controller using an ATmega microcontroller.
The wii remote extension should be connected to the SCL and SDA ports on the AVR and the N64 data pin should be connected to PD1.

This code has only been tested with an ATMega328p(Arduino), but should work with most ATmegas.

The code used to communicate with the wiimote is a modified version of Frank Zhao's wii drum controller code which can be found at https://code.google.com/p/circle-of-current/. This project would not have been possible without it.
